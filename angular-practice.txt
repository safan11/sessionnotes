Question Title: Product Inventory Status


Important Instructions:
- You may choose ONE of the following approaches:
  1. Implement everything directly in AppComponent
     (app.component.ts and app.component.html)
     OR
  2. Create a separate component (e.g., ProductInventoryComponent)
     and call/use it inside AppComponent.

- The files provided are:
  - app.component.ts
  - app.component.html
- If you create an additional component, it must be properly
  declared and used inside AppComponent.


Problem Description:
Create a simple Product Inventory feature using Angular that demonstrates
basic Angular concepts such as data binding, conditional rendering,
and list rendering.


Concepts to Demonstrate:
- Data Binding (Interpolation)
- Conditional Rendering using *ngIf
- List Rendering using *ngFor
- Basic event handling (click event)
- Component to template data flow


Requirements:
1. Define the following variables in the component class:
   - storeName (string)
   - isStoreOpen (boolean)
   - products (array of strings)

2. Display the store name in the template using interpolation.

3. Display a message based on store status:
   - If isStoreOpen is true, display: "Store is Open"
   - If isStoreOpen is false, display: "Store is Closed"

4. Display the list of products using *ngFor.

5. If the products list is empty, display the message:
   - "No products available"

6. Add a button to toggle the store status
   (Open ↔ Closed).

7. Display the total number of products available.

8. Add a button to clear all products from the list and
   verify conditional rendering when the list becomes empty.


Sample Data:
storeName = 'Smart Electronics';
isStoreOpen = true;
products = ['Laptop', 'Mobile', 'Headphones'];


Expected UI Behavior:
- Store name should be displayed on the screen.
- Store status message should change based on isStoreOpen value.
- Products should be displayed as a list.
- Total number of products should be shown.
- When products array is empty, show:
  "No products available".
- Clicking the toggle button should change the store status.
- Clicking the clear button should remove all products.


Evaluation Criteria:
- Correct usage of interpolation
- Proper use of *ngIf for conditional rendering
- Proper use of *ngFor for list rendering
- Correct event handling using (click)
- Clean and readable code structure
- Proper component usage if an additional component is created
