Data binding:-
--------------- 
   
 Data binding connects component data with the template. 
    component-> .ts 
    template-> html 

Angular supports four types of data binding.
It keeps UI and logic synchronized automatically.
Reduces manual DOM manipulation.
Used in almost every Angular application. 

 
 {{}}   --> String interpolation
 []     --> property binding 
 ()     --> event binding 
 [()]    --> two way data binding (property binding + event binding)
             (banana in a box). 

=====================================================
Data binding:- all about connecting html and ts file 
Directive :- structure of html element, 

============================================

Directives modify DOM behavior or appearance.
Structural directives change DOM structure.
